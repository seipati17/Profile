                            <p>Hello! My name is Seipati Frans, and I am currently an honours student at the University of Johannesburg, pursuing a BCom in Information Systems. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and constantly
                                seek opportunities to learn and grow in this dynamic field. Throughout my academic journey, I have maintained a high standard of excellence, reflected in my consistent academic achievements. My dedication to learning extends
                                beyond the classroom. I have actively engaged in extracurricular activities and leadership roles that have honed my skills and shaped my character. Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am a social and approachable
                                person who enjoys networking and making connections. I am also passionate about soccer, which I play regularly, and I find joy in volunteering, particularly at a primary school through the Community Engagement initiative
                                at my university. These activities have not only enriched my personal life but have also contributed to my development as a well-rounded individual. I am a fast learner, versatile, and highly committed to my goals. I possess
                                strong verbal and written communication skills, strategic thinking, and an ability to adapt to different situations. My technical skills include basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, RPA and proficiency in Microsoft
                                Office and Excel. Looking ahead, I aspire to contribute to technological innovation and research in Information Systems. I am driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact and am constantly seeking opportunities to expand
                                my knowledge and skills in this ever-evolving field</p>
